This was my B.Tech final year project done with my batchmates in a team, it tackles a complex variation of the Capacitated Mixed Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (CMF-VRP) with heterogeneous fleets and real-world constraints. We implemented and compared Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Guided Local Search (GLS), demonstrating ALNS's superior cost efficiency and scalability. The project includes visualization tools for route analysis and decision-making
